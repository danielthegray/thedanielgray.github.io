# Who is this guy?
I am a Christian, a programmer, a musician, a videogamer, a Tolkien fan, among
other things.

I like to program (a lot) and am currently working in Java during the day.

I like Unix/Linux, shell tools, networking, and learning new things every day.

I am still kind of getting the hang of all the web stuff... so bear with me!
And feel free to send any suggestions to.... uh.... I don't want to put my email
in plain text here just yet. :) I'll update it hear when I figure something out.
