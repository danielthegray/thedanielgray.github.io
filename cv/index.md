# Who is this guy?
I am a Christian, a programmer, a musician, a videogamer, a Tolkien fan, among
other things.

I like to program (a lot) and am currently working in Java during the day.
I've been paid (in the past) mainly to write Java, C#, SQL, JavaScript (+other
web things).
I've worked in C, C++, Perl, Python, etc. mostly as part of my school work.

I like Unix/Linux, shell tools, networking, and learning new things every day.

I am still kind of getting the hang of all the web stuff... so bear with me!
And feel free to send any suggestions to.... uh.... I don't want to put my email
in plain text here just yet. :) I'll update it here when I figure something out.

I studied for 4.5 years in Bolivia (at the Universidad Privada Boliviana) where
I got the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. (2009-2013)

I worked a few jobs after that.

I did an internship at a telecom provider, doing SNMP polling on all the servers
& routers of the company and consolidating it into Cacti server, where I got my
first exposure to Perl.

I worked at a startup doing Android development work for almost a year. I mostly
did Java there, although I also did a large amount of PHP development on the
backend and I also administered the Linux servers where the code and other
things (like test environments) were hosted.

After that, I worked at Thomson Reuters for little over than a year and a half,
doing development on the Micro$oft stack (C#, .NET, SQL Server) and also on Java
from time to time.
I also did some Android development work during my final months there.

After that, I got a scholarship from the Simón I. Patiño Foundation in Bolivia
to go to Lausanne, Switzerland and do a Master's in Computer Science, at the
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). There, I studied distributed
systems, Cryptography, some networking, concurrent algorithms, and met a lot of
amazing people.
